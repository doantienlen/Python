Important: If both image and text are given on Button, the text will be dominated and only image will appear on the Button. But if you want to show both image and text then you have to pass compound in button options.
- Button(master, text = "Button", image = "image.png", compound=LEFT)

  + compound = LEFT -> image will be at left side of the button
  + compound = RIGHT -> image will be at right side of button
  + compound = TOP -> image will be at top of button
  + compound = BOTTOM -> image will be at bottom of button

- Syntax:  photo = PhotoImage(file = r"part_of_file")
